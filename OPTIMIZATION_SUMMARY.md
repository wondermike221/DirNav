## 10. File Structure Optimization

### Before Optimization
```
src/
├── components/          # 8 component files
├── utils/              # 5 utility files
├── DirnavUI.tsx        # 800+ lines, minimal documentation
├── types.ts            # Basic type definitions
└── style.css           # CSS with syntax errors
```

### After Optimization
```
src/
├── components/          # 8 well-documented component files
├── utils/              # 5 optimized utility files with comprehensive docs
